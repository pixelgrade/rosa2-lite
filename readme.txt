== Recommended Plugins ==

To **take full advantage of Rosa2 Lite,** we recommend you install and activate the following two WordPress plugins:
1. [Nova Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nova-blocks/) for **easy-to-use custom Gutenberg blocks**
2. [Customify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customify/) for access to **Style Manager via the Customizer** for easy styling customization.

Both these plugins are developed and maintained by us, Pixelgrade, and they are both reviewed and distributed by the WordPress.org repository.
You will be prompted upon theme activation to install and activate these plugins, so no need to to anything manually. However, it is up to you if you wish to use them.
